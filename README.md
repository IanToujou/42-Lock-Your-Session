42 Lock Your Session is a small tool to make students at 42, especially pisciners, lock their session.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository or download one of the [Releases](https://github.com/IanToujou/42-Lock-Your-Session/releases) to get started.
- Execute the `start.sh` script.

## Usage

```sh
# Play an animation from the animation/ folder
./start.sh <animation> <name>

# Display lock.gif after locking your session
./start.sh lock
```

Note that the image will only display **after** locking the screen.

You can also use `CTRL` `+` or `CTRL` `-` to adjust the size of your terminal, if necessary. You can use the `F11` key to enter and exit **fullscreen** mode in the terminal.
